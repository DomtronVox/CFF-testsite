# What is Christian Furry Fellowship

We are a group of Christian furries and fans assembled together (since the late 90s) to serve God, encourage one another and make a positive influence on the Furry Fandom at large. 

We are committed to seeing authentic faith in the Good News of Jesus not just surviving in the fandom, but thriving to become a genuine source of bountiful community, creativity and friendships both in the Fandom and out.
